            <h2>Quantum Metric - Senior Software Engineer</h2>
            <h5>January 2023 - Present | Redmond, WA, USA</h5>
            <p>
              As a Senior Software Engineer, I became the SME (Subject Matter
              Expert) in many areas to help fulfil the fast moving and
              constantly changing requirements of working in a startup
              environment. I worked directly with our SVP of Engineering to
              create a highly technical feature, Focus Mode, that introduced an
              entirely new solution to querying for data from our <b>Big Query</b>
              data warehouse within a specific user defined context. I piloted
              a service creation workflow by learning <b>Go (Golang)</b> from
              scratch, and standing up a query caching service for ad hoc
              queries to be sent off when an alert is fired. I worked closely
              with our product and field teams via <b>Jira</b> to collaborate on critical
              features and quirks of our platform, from data visualization to
              mathematical statistics problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've also started taking on a lot more responsibility that falls
              under a staff role. I've orchestrated discussions around unit
              testing (and what constitutes meaningful tests) in our codebase,
              and laid the foundation of <b>Jest</b> and <b>React Testing Library</b> unit
              tests with initial unit tests, mocks, and <b>Gitlab</b> pipeline
              configurations. This lead to the entire engineering department
              adopting the culture of unit testing, greatly improving our
              codebase and increased our resilience against regressions. I've
              promoted a culture of documentation and education, by adding
              vital coverage to legacy and core portions of the codebase that
              is less well understood and excruciatingly hard to maintain.
              I've strongly encouraged peers to not be afraid to dig deep into
              legacy code, and have volunteered countless hours to guiding
              them along the process of learning to navigate legacy code, such as our home grown state management based
              off <b>Redux</b> or <b>Class Based React</b> components. I
              have also frequently attended meetings in the place of, or in
              addition to, staff engineers to provide a more technical insight
              to the discussion at hand, whether that's dissecting the
              feasibility of a new feature or architecting a new solution
              across engineering departments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I have also had a lasting impact on our company's
              platform. I was a fundamental part of the effort to improve the
              less than desirable performance, by breaking down legacy code
              and experimenting with various fixes such as adjusting our <b>Web Worker</b> configurations, optimizing
              legacy code, and benchmarking various solutions. This led to a reduction of query time from
              over 5 seconds to around 3 seconds for data heavy clients. On
              the security side, a security audit deemed our platform needed
              an upgrade to <b>HTTPOnly</b> (disable client side script access to
              cookies). I collaborated with a staff engineer to complete this
              upgrade in time for the security audit deadline to ensure we
              were up to date with security best practices. Lastly, and most
              recently, I was heavily involved with multiple features that
              helped secure a >$10 million USD deal with a major US
              telecommunications client, by providing my expertise to aid
              peers, leading discussions between engineers, product, and field
              members, and designing and writing out core features.

            <h2>Quantum Metric - Front End Software Engineer</h2>
            <h5>
              March 2022 - January 2023 | Fremont, CA, USA & Redmond, WA, USA
            </h5>
            <p>
              I joined Quantum Metric as an intermediate software engineer to
              work on the <b>React</b>, <b>MobX</b>, and <b>Node.js</b> based <b>Typescript</b> app, but thanks to my
              exceptional performance in refactoring legacy code and promoting
              reusable and DRY concepts, as well as showing independence and
              persistence in my work, I was quickly put on track to being
              promoted to a Senior Software Engineer within the next possible
              promotion cycle.

              Nisum (at SF Based Fortune 500 consumer retail client) - Front
              End Software Engineer
            </h2>
            <h5>July 2020 - March 2022 | Fremont, CA, USA</h5>
            <p>
              I was quickly identified as a strong candidate to work at one of
              Nisum's largest clients. As I got more familiar with <b>Vue</b>, I also
              learned the ins and outs of working with a corporate codebase
              with a <b>MFE (micro frontends)</b> architecture. I quickly picked up
              unfamiliar technology such as <b>Java</b>, <b>Web Components</b>, <b>SVN</b>,
              <b>Jenkins</b>, etc. to more effectively perform my job of migrating
              the older legacy components to a newer <b>Javascript</b> Vue-based
              micro frontend. As my technical skill and leadership was
              becoming more apparent, I was also tasked with being involved in
              the hiring process of (senior) software engineers for the
              client.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I was identified as the perfect engineer to work
              on migrating the complex build script from <b>Bash</b> scripts to a
              Node based process. I architected the solution with discussion
              with and direction from the principal engineer, and replaced two
              senior engineers who were previously working on the effort (but
              were't delivering results). This Node based process bundled
              together multiple micro frontends with the server,
              productionized the output by running through industry standard
              bundlers and pre/post-processors, and configured with
              proprietary company configuration to produce unique outputs for
              6 different client brand websites. When I left the company, the
              highly efficient process that I single handedly built was
              running at 4 9's reliability (99.99% uptime/success rate)

              and other helpful libraries to prepare for upcoming client work.
