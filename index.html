              <h2>Quantum Metric - Senior Software Engineer</h2>
              <h5>January 2023 - Present | Redmond, WA, USA</h5>
              <p>
                As a Senior Software Engineer, I became the SME (Subject Matter
                Expert) in many areas to help fulfil the fast moving and
                constantly changing requirements of working in a startup
                environment. I worked directly with our SVP of Engineering to
                create a highly technical feature, Focus Mode that introduced an
                entirely new solution to querying for data from our Big Query
                data warehouse within a specific user defined context. I piloted
                a service creation workflow by learning Go (Golang) from
                scratch, and standing up a query caching service for ad hoc
                queries to be sent off when an alert is fired. I worked closely
                with our product and field teams to collaborate on critical
                features and quirks of our platform, from data visualization to
                mathematical statistics problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've also started taking on a lot more responsibility that falls
                under a staff role. I've orchestrated discussions around unit
                testing (and what constitutes meaningful tests) in our codebase,
                and laid the foundation of Jest + React Testing Library unit
                tests with initial unit tests, mocks, and Gitlab pipeline
                configurations. This lead to the entire engineering department
                adopting the culture of unit testing, greatly improving our
                codebase and increased our resilience against regressions. I've
                promoted a culture of documentation and education, by adding
                vital coverage to legacy and core portions of the codebase that
                is less well understood and excruciatingly hard to maintain.
                I've strongly encouraged peers to not be afraid to dig deep into
                legacy code, and have volunteered countless hours to guiding
                them along the process of learning to navigate legacy code. I
                have also frequently attended meetings in the place of, or in
                addition to, staff engineers to provide a more technical insight
                to the discussion at hand, whether that's dissecting the
                feasibility of a new feature or architecting a new solution
                across engineering departments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, I have also had a lasting impact on our company's
                platform. I was a fundamental part of the effort to improve the
                less than desirable performance, by breaking down legacy code
                and experimenting with various fixes such as adjusting our web
                worker configurations, optimizing legacy code, and benchmarking
                various solutions. This led to a reduction of query time from
                over 5 seconds to around 3 seconds for data heavy clients. On
                the security side, a security audit deemed our platform needed
                an upgrade to HTTPOnly (disable client side script access to
                cookies). I collaborated with a staff engineer to complete this
                upgrade in time for the security audit deadline to ensure we
                were up to date with security best practices. Lastly, and most
                recently, I was heavily involved with multiple features that
                helped secure a >$10 million USD deal with a major US
                telecommunications client, by providing my expertise to aid
                peers, leading discussions between engineers, product, and field
                members, and designing and writing out core features.

              <h2>Quantum Metric - Front End Software Engineer</h2>
              <h5>
                March 2022 - January 2023 | Fremont, CA, USA & Redmond, WA, USA
              </h5>
              <p>
                I joined Quantum Metric as an intermediate software engineer to
                work on the React, MobX, and Node.js based app, but thanks to my
                exceptional performance in refactoring legacy code and promoting
                reusable and DRY concepts, as well as showing independence and
                persistence in my work, I was quickly put on track to being
                promoted to a Senior Software Engineer within the next possible
                promotion cycle.

                Nisum (at SF Based Fortune 500 consumer retail client) - Front
                End Software Engineer
              </h2>
              <h5>July 2020 - March 2022 | Fremont, CA, USA</h5>
              <p>
                I was quickly identified as a strong candidate to work at one of
                Nisum's largest clients. As I got more familiar with Vue, I also
                learned the ins and outs of working with a corporate codebase
                with a MFE (micro frontends) architecture. I quickly picked up
                unfamiliar technology such as Java, Web Components, SVN,
                Jenkins, etc. to more effectively perform my job of migrating
                the older legacy components to a newer Javascript Vue-based
                micro frontend. As my technical skill and leadership was
                becoming more apparent, I was also tasked with being involved in
                the hiring process of (senior) software engineers for the
                client.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, I was identified as the perfect engineer to work
                on migrating the complex build script from bash scripts to a
                Node based process. I architected the solution with discussion
                with and direction from the principal engineer, and replaced two
                senior engineers who were previously working on the effort (but
                were't delivering results). This Node based process bundled
                together multiple micro frontends with the server,
                productionized the output by running through industry standard
                bundlers and pre/post-processors, and configured with
                proprietary company configuration to produce unique outputs for
                6 different client brand websites. When I left the company, the
                highly efficient process that I single handedly built was
                running at 4 9's reliability (99.99% uptime/success rate)

              <p>
                As a software engineer consultant, I worked on various projects,
                mostly involving migrating from legacy systems to a html
                handlebars based system. During this time, I also learned Vue
                and other helpful libraries to prepare for upcoming client work.
